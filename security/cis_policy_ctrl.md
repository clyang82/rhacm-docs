# CIS policy controller

You can use the Center for Internet Security (CIS) policy controller to receive notifications about non-compliant clusters. **Note**: THe CIS policy controller is only supported on OpenShift Container Platform 3.11.

The CIS policy controller monitors the nodes in a cluster for compliance against CIS Kubernetes benchmark checks. The CIS policies that list the rules to exclude can be applied to the managed clusters. The controller checks the cluster for any violations that are not in the exclude list.

The controller uses `aqua-security` and `kube-bench` tool to check the master and worker nodes in the managed cluster for compliance. 

When a managed cluster is non-compliant, the CIS controller assigns a risk score. Each CIS rule that fails the check is assigned a score. The risk score that is assigned to the non-compliant cluster is the maximum of all the scores that are assigned to failed checks.

The risk score is on a scale of 1 to 10.
*  If the score is less than 4, then the risk category is `low`.
*  If the score is greater than or equal to 4, and less than or equal to 7, then the risk category is `medium`.
*  If the score is greater than 7, then the risk category is `high`.

<!--added the components for the moment, will clean up-->
## CIS policy controller components

The CIS policy controller consists of the following four components.

* `cis-controller-minio`: The `cis-controller-minio` object store is used to store the artifacts that are collected by the CIS crawler that runs on all the master and worker nodes. The results from running the aqua-security kube-bench tool are also stored in the CIS Minio object store.

* `cis-crawler`: The `cis-crawler` collects information about Kubernetes processes, binary files, and configuration files and stores them in the Minio object store. The crawler runs on the master and worker nodes. The crawler runs every 24 hours.

* `drishti-cis`: The `drishti-cis` component runs the aqua-security kube-bench tool against the artifacts that are collected by the `cis-crawler` and stores the results in `cis-controller-minio` object store. The artifacts are scanned every 24 hours.

* `cis-controller`: The `cis-controller` scans the `cis-controller-minio` object store for results that are generated by the aqua-security kube-bench tool and updates the CIS policy status. The controller scans the results every 24 hours or whenever the policy is updated.
